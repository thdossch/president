        Class that represents a game of President

        A Game exists out of multiple rounds, a round is until only one player did not skip
        Exemple game with 5 players: 
            Game: 
                round -> p1 wins, he can start next round
                round -> p3 wins, he can start next round
                ...
                round -> p1 wins, and has no cards left
                      -> p1 is president

                The game continues
                round -> p3 wins, he can start next round
                ...
                round -> p2 wins, and has no cards left
                      -> p2 is vice-president
                
                The game continues
                round -> p2 wins, he can start next round
                ...
                round -> p3 wins, and has no cards left
                      -> p3 is a Person
                
                The game continues
                round -> p5 wins, he can start next round
                ...
                round -> p4 wins, and has no cards left
                      -> p4 is high-scum
                      -> p5 is scum

            Now a new game can be played with the obtained ranks
